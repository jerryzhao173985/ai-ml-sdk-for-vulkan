echo "Key Achievements:"
echo "✓ Created comprehensive macOS ARM64 compatibility layer"
echo "✓ Fixed Vulkan C++ bindings for macOS"
echo "✓ Added RAII wrapper classes"
echo "✓ Implemented ARM ML SDK extensions (VK_ARM_tensors, VK_ARM_data_graph)"
echo "✓ Fixed namespace and type conversion issues"
echo "✓ Added missing structure constructors"
