# ARM ML SDK for Vulkan - macOS ARM64 Build Progress

## Session Summary
This session continued from previous work that achieved 43% build success on the ARM ML SDK for Vulkan on macOS ARM64 (M4 Max).

## Major Achievements

### 1. Fixed Critical Vulkan C++ Compatibility Issues
- Created comprehensive vulkan_full_compat.hpp with proper Vulkan C++ bindings
- Fixed RAII constructor issues by using placement new for move-only objects
- Added missing acceleration structure type definitions
- Resolved namespace conflicts between system and SDK headers

### 2. Successfully Built VGF Library
- Built the VGF (Vulkan Graph Format) library component separately
- All 62 files compiled successfully
- Generated flatbuffers code and tools

### 3. Resolved Header Include Issues
- Fixed system vulkan_structs.hpp conflicts by using absolute paths to ARM ML SDK headers
- Ensured ARM ML extensions (VK_ARM_tensors, VK_ARM_data_graph) are properly included
- Added proper include guards and namespace management

### 4. Added Missing Vulkan Type Definitions
- Added enum class definitions for ImageTiling, ImageUsageFlagBits, FormatFeatureFlagBits
- Added Filter and SamplerMipmapMode enums with proper values
- Added RAII wrapper classes for Instance, Device, Buffer, DeviceMemory
- Added debug utils support structures

### 5. Error Reduction Progress
- Started with 100+ compilation errors
- Reduced to 45 errors through systematic fixes
- Main remaining issues:
  - Container insert operations (move semantics)
  - Some missing method implementations
  - Type conversion issues

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
1. `/sw/scenario-runner/src/compat/vulkan_full_compat.hpp` - Main compatibility layer
2. `/sw/scenario-runner/src/vulkan_memory_manager.hpp` - Fixed RAII assignment issues
3. `/sw/scenario-runner/src/buffer.cpp` - Fixed RAII object construction
4. `/sw/scenario-runner/src/vulkan_debug_utils.hpp` - Removed duplicate includes

### Build Configuration
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DSCENARIO_RUNNER_ENABLE_TENSORS=ON \
  -DARGPARSE_PATH=/path/to/argparse \
  -DML_SDK_VGF_LIB_PATH=/path/to/vgf-lib \
  -DFLATBUFFERS_PATH=/path/to/flatbuffers \
  -DVULKAN_HEADERS_PATH=/path/to/Vulkan-Headers \
  -DGLSLANG_PATH=/path/to/glslang \
  -DENABLE_OPT=0
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining 45 compilation errors
2. Address container insert issues with proper move semantics
3. Complete scenario runner build
4. Test integration of all components
5. Create comprehensive test suite

## Recommendations
- Consider creating a macOS-specific branch for easier maintenance
- Document all macOS-specific changes for future contributors
- Submit patches upstream for better macOS support
- Create automated CI/CD for macOS builds
