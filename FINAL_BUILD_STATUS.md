# ML SDK for Vulkan - Build Status Report

## Summary
The ML SDK for Vulkan build encountered compatibility issues with the current state of the dependencies, specifically:

1. **SPIRV-Tools**: Contains work-in-progress ML extensions that don't compile
2. **Model Converter**: Depends on SPIRV ML extensions that aren't fully implemented

## Successfully Built Components
✅ **VGF Library** - Successfully built with all features:
- Location: `sw/vgf-lib/build/`
- Executables:
  - `vgf_dump` - Tool to inspect and extract VGF files
  - `vgf_samples` - Sample applications
- Libraries:
  - `libvgf.a` - Static library for VGF encoding/decoding

## Components That Failed to Build
❌ **Model Converter** - Failed due to undefined SPIRV ML extensions:
- Missing: `spirv::GraphEntryPointARMOp`
- Missing: `CreateGraphShapePass`
- Issue: The SPIRV-Tools and MLIR dependencies have incomplete ML-specific extensions

❌ **Scenario Runner** - Depends on SPIRV-Tools which has compilation errors

❌ **Emulation Layer** - Same SPIRV-Tools dependency issues

## Root Cause
The repository appears to be using a development branch of SPIRV-Tools with experimental ML extensions that are not yet complete. The specific commit (`4ed8384f WIP graph shaping pass prototype`) indicates work-in-progress code.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Binaries
Check if ARM provides pre-built binaries for your platform instead of building from source.

### Option 2: Use Stable Branch
The repository may need to be synced to a stable branch/tag instead of development branches:
```bash
cd dependencies/SPIRV-Tools
git checkout <stable-tag>
cd ../SPIRV-Headers
git checkout <matching-tag>
```

### Option 3: Fix Dependencies
Report the issue to the maintainers - the current dependency configuration appears to be broken.

### Option 4: Use What's Available
The VGF Library is functional and can be used for:
- Encoding VGF files programmatically
- Decoding and inspecting existing VGF files
- Understanding the VGF format

## What You Can Do Now

With the successfully built VGF Library:

```bash
# Use vgf_dump to inspect VGF files
sw/vgf-lib/build/vgf_dump/vgf_dump --help

# Run sample applications
sw/vgf-lib/build/samples/vgf_samples
```

## Technical Details
- System: macOS with Apple Silicon (16 cores, 64GB RAM)
- Compiler: Apple Clang 17.0.0
- Build System: Ninja
- LLVM: Successfully downloaded and partially built
- Issue: ML-specific SPIRV extensions are incomplete in the current codebase

## Next Steps
1. Check the official ARM ML SDK documentation for known issues
2. Look for stable release tags instead of development branches
3. Consider using Docker images if available
4. Contact ARM support for guidance on the correct dependency versions
