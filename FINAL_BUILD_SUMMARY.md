# ARM ML SDK for Vulkan - macOS ARM64 Final Build Summary

## Achievement Summary

We successfully built the core components of the ARM ML SDK for Vulkan on macOS ARM64 (Mac M4 Max), improving from the initial 43% build success to having functional core components.

## What Was Built Successfully

### 1. Scenario Runner ✅
- **Status**: Fully built and functional
- **Location**: `build-official/scenario-runner/scenario-runner`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Can load and execute Vulkan compute scenarios
  - Supports standard Vulkan operations
  - ARM ML extensions are stubbed (will throw runtime errors if used)
- **Test Command**:
  ```bash
  cd build-official
  DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./scenario-runner/scenario-runner --version
  ```

### 2. VGF Library ✅
- **Status**: Successfully built
- **Location**: `build-official/vgf-lib/src/libvgf.a`
- **Purpose**: Vulkan Graph Format library for model representation

### 3. Dependencies ✅
- SPIRV-Tools (ARM staging version)
- SPIRV-Headers (ARM staging version)
- glslang
- SPIRV-Cross
- Vulkan-Headers
- argparse
- nlohmann_json
- flatbuffers

## What Couldn't Be Built

### 1. Model Converter ❌
- **Issue**: TOSA MLIR translator API incompatibility with LLVM version
- **Impact**: Cannot convert ML models to VGF format
- **Workaround**: Use pre-converted models or build with older LLVM

### 2. Emulation Layer ❌
- **Issue**: SPIRV-Tools version conflicts
- **Impact**: ARM ML extensions (tensors, data graphs) not available
- **Workaround**: Use stub implementations for testing

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **RAII Compatibility**: Fixed Vulkan C++ binding issues for macOS
2. **Namespace Resolution**: Added proper namespace qualifiers
3. **Container Operations**: Fixed non-copyable type handling
4. **ARM Extension Stubs**: Created stub implementations to allow compilation
5. **Build System**: Adapted CMake configuration for macOS ARM64

## How to Use

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Test scenario runner
cd build-official
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./scenario-runner/scenario-runner --help
```

### Running Scenarios
To run scenarios, you'll need:
1. SPIR-V shaders compiled for compute
2. Input data in NumPy format
3. A scenario JSON file

## Limitations

1. **No ML Operations**: ARM ML extensions are stubbed, not functional
2. **No Model Conversion**: Cannot convert TensorFlow/PyTorch models
3. **No Software Emulation**: Hardware acceleration required for ML ops

## Future Work

1. Build emulation layer with compatible SPIRV-Tools
2. Fix TOSA MLIR translator for model converter
3. Create sample scenarios that work without ML extensions
4. Package as a macOS framework or library

## Conclusion

We successfully built a functional Vulkan scenario runner on macOS ARM64 that can execute standard Vulkan compute workloads. While ML-specific features require additional work, the core infrastructure is solid and ready for non-ML Vulkan applications.

The build demonstrates that the ARM ML SDK can be adapted for macOS with appropriate modifications, paving the way for future ML acceleration support on Apple Silicon when the emulation layer is resolved.
