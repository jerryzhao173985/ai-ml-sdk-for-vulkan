# ML SDK for Vulkan Build Summary

## Current Status

### Successfully Built Components:
1. **VGF Library** - Built successfully with Ninja
   - Location: `build-official/vgf-lib/`
   - Includes flatc compiler

2. **SPIRV-Tools** - Built from official Khronos repository
   - Static libraries built successfully
   - Location: `build-official/emulation-layer/spirv-tools/`

3. **glslang** - Built successfully
   - Static libraries built
   - Location: `build-official/emulation-layer/glslang/`

### Failed Components:
1. **Model Converter** - Cannot build on macOS
   - Build scripts only support Linux and Windows
   - Would require LLVM/MLIR patches that may not work with official LLVM

2. **Scenario Runner** - Build fails due to ML extension issues
   - The Vulkan C++ headers (vulkan_raii.hpp) don't properly expose ARM ML extensions
   - Extensions like `vk::TensorARM`, `vk::TensorMemoryBarrierARM` are missing
   - C headers have the definitions but C++ wrapper doesn't expose them

3. **Emulation Layer** - Partially built
   - Some components built but full emulation layer incomplete

## Root Causes:

### 1. Platform Support
- Build scripts explicitly check for platform and reject Darwin (macOS)
- Only Linux and Windows are officially supported

### 2. Vulkan ML Extensions Issue
- The ARM ML extensions for Vulkan are present in vulkan_core.h
- However, the C++ bindings (vulkan.hpp, vulkan_raii.hpp) don't properly expose these types
- This might require regenerating the C++ headers with proper extension support

### 3. SPIRV-Tools ML Extensions
- The original issue with ARM's SPIRV-Tools fork having incomplete ML extensions was bypassed
- Using official Khronos SPIRV-Tools works for basic components

## Recommendations:

1. **For macOS Development:**
   - Use a Linux VM or container for full SDK building
   - The provided Dockerfile shows Ubuntu 22.04 as the target platform

2. **For Native macOS Usage:**
   - Can use the VGF Library for container format operations
   - Cannot use Model Converter without significant porting effort
   - Cannot use Scenario Runner without fixing Vulkan header generation

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Set up a Docker container using the provided Dockerfile
   - Build inside the Linux container for full functionality
   - Or use a Linux machine for development

## Build Commands Used:

```bash
# Successful partial build
cmake -S . -B build-official -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DMODEL_CONVERTER_APPLY_LLVM_PATCH=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DVK_ENABLE_BETA_EXTENSIONS"

ninja -C build-official -j 16
```

## Components That Can Be Used on macOS:
- VGF Library (for reading/writing VGF container files)
- SPIRV-Tools (for SPIR-V manipulation)
- glslang (for GLSL to SPIR-V compilation)
